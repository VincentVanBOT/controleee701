controleee
==========

ControlEee? is an application written in Python/Qt4 that allows users to turn on/off bluetooth, webcam and wlan devices on a EeePC. Often these devices are not used and if they remain active, they increase the power consumption. So if you want your battery to last longer, it's a good idea to turn them off.
